            <h2 class="section-heading">Hi!</h2>
		<p class="section-content">
I am Dakshesh, an 18MS Batch alumnus. At the time of publishing this website, I am pursuing a PhD programme in Statistics, at the Dept. of Statistics and Probability, Michigan State University.<br>
<br>
My academic/research interests are in Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes. So far, I have completed courses in measure-theoretic Probability Theory, measure theory, functional analysis, differential geometry, topology, statistical inference, linear model methodology, machine learning & Network analysis, multivariate analysis, and time series analysis. I have studied Prof. Robert J. Adler's monograph notes that detail some recent developments in probabilistic analysis of Gaussian processes, particularly the concepts of entropy and majorising measures with specific focus on their use in analysis of almost sure continuity and distribution of suprema of Gaussian processes. I have also been introduced to extreme value theory through an Independent study. I aim to pursue these topics in the future.<br>
<br>
My other interests include history, public policy, languages, and cultures of different places; domestic and international geopolitics; and my own analysis into philosophy, and truth. Naturally, I like listening to stories, discussing and debating, and exploring the world as much as I can. I also wish to contribute to the development of my country, culture, identity, and planet to the best of my abilitiy. 
</p> 

<h2 class='section-heading'>An Overview of My time at IISER Kolkata</h2>
<p class='section-content'>  
I joined the <a href="https://iiserkol.ac.in">IISER Kolkata</a> community when I secured admission into the <a href='https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/academic/programmes/5-year-bs-ms-dual-degree-programme/'>BS-MS Dual Degree Programme</a> in 2018 (18MS Batch). My pursuit of science after I graduated from the <a href='https://ihsdubai.org/'>Indian High School Dubai (CBSE affiliated)</a> led me here. My experience in the first year had me choose a unique combination of Earth Science, Mathematics, and Life Sciences. In the second year, my friends and I had fun organizing Freshers, Teachers' Day, Janmashtami, and <a href='https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~outreach/initiatives.html'>Ek Pehal Outreach</a> events. I also took up my first-ever role of such stature: the Sposorship/Marketing Executive for <a href='https://inquivesta.in/'>Inquivesta, IISER Kolkata's annual festival</a>. I was never any kind of sport-star, but I did keep myself fit through Kho-Kho, Athletics, and practice for the <a href='http://www3.iiserpune.ac.in/events/Inter+IISER+Sports+Meet+2019'>Inter IISER Sports Meet 2019</a> (though like I said, I didn't achieve anything that warrants mention/stardom in sports) where I ran the 400m for IISER Kolkata. Though I initially thought that I would take up Life Sciences, I ended up struggling to choose between Math and Earth Science; and finally chose Mathematics as my major.<br>
<br>
During the third and fourth years, my Math major batchmates and I persevered through the well-known IISERK-DMS Curriculum. Simultaneously, with other friends across batches and institutes, I also organized an online <a href='https://revival.iiserkol.ac.in'>cultural festival (Revival 2021) across the seven IISERs across India, NISER Bhubaneshwar, UM-DAE CEBS Mumbai, and IISc Bangalore</a>, and took on the posts of General Secretary, <a href='https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~sac/com.html'>Student Affairs Council</a> (Cultural 2020-22', acting-Academic 2021-22'), Publicity Head at <a href='scicomm.iiserkol.ac.in'>Cogito137 - IISERK's scicomm initiative</a>, and placement coordinator (2021-22'), <a href='https://ccd.iiserkol.ac.in'>Centre for Career Development</a>. These years provided me an immense opportunity to experience and gain diverse skills and learn to handle pressure of different kinds resulting from juggling several posts amidst an intensive mathematics curriculum. My most fun memories from IISER Kolkata are from group studies, funny/real moments with professors, and group meetings conducted toward my role obligations as IISER Kolkata's Senate and Undergraduate Academic Committee Student Representative.<br>
<br>
In my third year, I took both S-Stream and M-Stream Courses. In the fourth year, I decided to pursue the S-stream. I had initially strayed away from mainstream sciences toward mathematics because of my inclination toward real analysis. Later, measure theory and functional analysis courses took its place. When they required a good grasp of both, I liked trying to prove established results in probability theory. In my fifth year, I requested Dr. Anirvan Chakraborty, Asst. Professor, IISER Kolkata to guide my interest. He recommended and helped me read <a href='https://www.jstor.org/stable/4355563'>Prof. Robert J. Adler's Monograph Notes titled, 'An Introduction to Continuity and Extrema of General Gaussian Processes' (1990)</a> which sheds light on relatively recent developments in probabilistic analysis of stochastic processes. My <a href='Academics/finalun.pdf'>MS Project Report</a> consists of my own understanding of whatever I read thus: specifically my interpretation of the immense applicability of the concepts of entropy and majorising measures in the analysis of continuity and distribution of suprema of any Gaussian process, regardless of the space it exists in (with a few basic assumptions that are almost always guaranteed in processes of usual interest). I also undertook an independent study in Extreme Value Theory under his guidance, to explore the interface of probability theory and statistics. My experience as a teaching assistant for three courses between my last two years at IISER also allowed me to brush up fundamentals before graduating. I enjoyed teaching fundamental concepts to students being introduced to real analysis for the first time!
<br><br>
During my final year, I tried my best to guide juniors who wanted to take up posts in the student council, placement-related, and fest-related activities as I was relieving myself from Senate/UGAC responsibilities. We also hosted a Pongal festival in collaboration with other harvest festival celebrations at IISERK. All this involved several discussions in the ICVS Hostel where I lived, as well as meetings with faculty and administration. As I was completing my BS-MS program, our team of three representing IISER Kolkata in the Inter IISER Cultural Meet 2023 bagged a Gold that led to IISER-K bringing back its Gold from IISc Bangalore who bagged it in the previous Cultural Meet (2019). In the last few months, my juniors and I conducted the annual fest's tenth edition finally after several postponements due to Covid-19 despite lack of administrative will and funding. Though the lack of funds meant a considerably small scale, we managed to pull off quality science events, profits, and institute-wide participation - three things that were missing in the last edition. I left with a hope that this would show how much students can be capable of if they allow themselves unity, and the admin provides reasonable support for a large-scale science festival that Inquivesta stood to be. 
<br><br>
Before leaving IISER, I gave talks on topics related to statistics or whatever I was studying, more than once, including at IISER Kolkata's DMS Day 2023 too. I also applied for a PhD position at <a href="msu.edu">Michigan State University (MSU)</a>, because of a particular Prof. Yimin Xiao, whose profile attracted me. Fortunately, I have just completed a course of Prof. Xiao's and I hope to do good research with his guidance soon. 
<br><br>
When I successfully recieved my Bachelor and Master Degrees during the Convocation Ceremony of 2023, I left the colourful skies of IISER Kolkata satisfied. With people who stayed in my hostel room to remember moments and allowed me an exit with a procession from F108, ICVS Hostel till our taxi while my family and I packed my things to take home forever. With friends who couldn't attend because of other commitments. With one who probably misses me the most but still couldn't afford to spend a lot of time on that last day. With faculty and staff wishing my friends and I well for whatever lies ahead. With the pride of having done more than just a little bit of everything at IISER Kolkata, academics and otherwise; knowing that not everyone gets to feel the same way.
