<div class="dropdown-heading" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown1')">0) Why did I go to IISER Kolkata?</div>
<div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdown1">
In school, I was always just a student that did what I was required/expected to. While I participated in things that came my way to the best of my ability, be it academics or extra-curricular activities; I never wanted anything or trained for something specifically. Whenever I failed to achieve some personal goal or expectation of my own making however, I used to make sure I beat myself the next time. <br>
<br>
When it was time for me to choose between commerce and science streams after 10th grade, I was interested in everything, did well in everything, and didn't want to give up anything. However, I was sure I loved sciences so I took all - Phy, Chem, Math, Bio combination. <br><br>
Again, after twelfth grade, I was required to choose my path forward, and again, I did not want to give up any of the sciences. My Indian environment gave me two choices: medical and engineering and I was only sure that I wanted neither because I felt I didn't have the passion for them. Also, after tenth, my parents were falsely coaxed by society and coaching centers that I needed to be enrolled into one to succeed in life. So, they ended up wasting an exhorbitantly high amount of money for a coaching centre for nothing in return except my constant feeling of debt and isolation from the many useless classes I wasted so much valuable time at. They were incapable of coaching for any of the exams that mattered and were suggesting students to pay for a costly SAT exam (which they were coaching for instead inspite of it already being considerably easier than the Real Exams) and get admission into an NIT through a costly quota called DASA that is intended for foreigners and West-based NRIs. I was determined to prove my coaching center wrong and proving to myself that I can get into a place that I actually want solely through merit without my parents' hard earned money being wasted further. <br><br>As I was giving all the competitive exams just in case, I came across the BS-MS Program at IISERs somewhere (mostly on Quora) and liked the study all, choose later model and interdisciplinary prospects. Something in me had me register for the IISER Aptitude Test and hope that I got in.<br><br> While choosing among IISERs, I used the NIRF 2018 ranking to select my order of preference since distance and other factors were not on my mind at all. 17MS Seniors had also written good feedback of IISER Kolkata on Quora, FB, etc. On July 6, 2018, I recieved my first round offer letter from my first preference, IISER Kolkata; and I happily accepted. </p>

<div class="dropdown-heading" onclick="toggleDropdown('d2')">1) 1st Year</div>   
<div class="dropdown-content" id="d2">
My first semester was pretty chill and decent. Academically there was no pressure. We had to go to classes from 8/9 am to 5 pm and after that we explored friendships, campus, and did typical first-year things. I had fun with the whole 'unlearn and relearn' process that some profs described and practiced. We learnt same concepts as in 12th grade but with a more fundamental approach to everything. In physics, it was about the definition of 'time' itself, in math, we were completely flabbergasted when we were being introduced to the idea that we do not know anything without first accepting Peano's axioms. In chemistry, interesting detail into molecular orbital theory to give a better and more contemporary perspective into inorganic and organic chemistry plus some fun lab experiments like printing, making your own dye, and doing a fingerprint analysis; took the stage. In life sciences, we learnt about life, evolution, and some other things that were covered in 12th grade. Earth Sciences introduced a field we did not delve into in school - from Earth, to planets in general, to dinosaurs. We also learnt basic Python coding in this semester. I spent many classes asleep because LHC 107 had Air conditioning and hence more comfortable than A108, Nivedita Hall at night. Nothing makes one sleep like a boring class (but always interesting when I actually gave things a read before the exams) coupled with A/C and reclining chairs.<br><br>
Second semester was a bit stricter and difficulty increased, though not beyond manageable. Instead of CS, we had Mathematical Methods which was more boring but I always scored good there somehow. This semester, I felt repelled to Chemistry mostly because I found that I wasn't patient enough for titrations in Chem Lab. I also felt reprelled to Physics because in this course, the prof. just assumed many tools and techniques that I was never formally introduced to before and hence I could never accept what was done in class. Even Phy Lab felt boring. I liked Math and ES. Life Sciences felt familiar because it was again 12th portion related and I already loved these concepts in school. Expts like DNA extraction etc were also better to me than Chem/Phy Labs. Before the endsemester exam, I actually finally gave myself time to read the physics portion and actually liked it. However, I had already opted for Earth Sci, Life Sci, and Math as my pre-majors for next year.<br><br>
In my 1st sem, I also had a sociology course which was surprisingly interesting. The 2nd sem, we had an English course that was boring because I have been fairly okay with english always. It is a helpful course for students who aren't familiar with english as it will help navigate the unfortunately english-dominated science at all our Indian institutes. 
</div>

<div class="dropdown-heading" onclick="toggleDropdown('d3')">2) 2nd Year</div>   
<div class="dropdown-content" id="d3">
Academically, 2nd year got quite tougher than first year. Plus, IISER Kolkata's culture up till then had 2nd years organize most events, be office bearers, etc. Each of the three pre-majors had 2/3 courses, and they covered heavy portions. I also never attended classes mentally and used to do the bare minimum (showing up for attendance). We used to stay awake till late for some reason or the other, and hence, always woke up late or just in time for the 8 am class. 

I remember eating breakfast with Harshwardhan, entering bio lab right after the introductory lectures, and being caught by the lab assistant who always spotted us, scolded us, but never gave us away. I also remember being lax on some projects and taking others very seriously. We didn't really have many regular assignments (maybe just the three assignments for Analysis which I did at the last minute). It was not until the exams, that I actually studied to be honest. That's when I realised that I loved Analysis, and didn't care much for linear algebra. I also loved Hydrology & Geodynamics, and Dr. Sayantan Sarkar's lectures about atmosphere dynamics and climate. The other courses, I really don't remember my feelings for them. 

The second semester started with me turning a new page and attending all analysis classes, while trying my best to attend other classes too. We had CS again so that was nice - drawing turtle graphics and all. Sushil sir's analysis course was really nice and drew me in more. Life Sciences at this point became bland, I felt the some instructors didn't really care to teach much, while the others were teaching things that I found to be very repetitive and obvious at this point. Lab was okay. Earth Sciences was nice, especially the Earthquake-related inverse theory stuff. 

Halfway through this semester, COVID began and we went online. Both ES and LS Depts were gracious with marks and I honestly didn't have to study for getting perfect grades there. Only the Math profs forced us to earn our marks atleast to some extent. So, by the end of the semester, when I was asked to choose my major and was confused between ES and MA, I chose MA. Because, MA was the only subject I felt like I knew enough to know that I don't know anything. I had my worst grades in MA and yet, I felt happier with them. I knew that MA would be challenging (courtesy: seniors) and that every mark I get would be an achievement whereas I wasn't sure that was the case in others, especially LS since there it felt like marks were being thrown away. 

Despite warnings by profs, seniors, batchmates, and the whole 'can definitely not do anything apart from studies if you take math' advice; I chose Math.

<!-- 
1) <b>DMS Day Symposium 2023</b>: I introduced 'Extreme Value Theory' to the DMS Day Audience, IISER Kolkata. <br>
2) <b>Loyola College, Akshar Arbol International School</b>: Lectured on Statistical Tools useful for research at PG-Level, and at a more dumbed-down school-level! <br></p> 
3) <b><a href="https://scicomm.iiserkol.ac.in">Cogito-137</a></b>: I was a founding member of Cogito137-IISER Kolkata's first and so far only scientific communication initiative. I setup the first Publicity Team as the first PR Manager, wrote an article on Covid-19, etc. We hosted many workshops online with dignitaries across the globe incl. Principal Scientific Advisor, GoI; and Scientists from top-universities across the world. <br>
4) <b>Ek Pehal</b>: Served the Ek Pehal IISER K initiative tending to helping underprivileged kids around campus, celebrating festivals with them, exposing them to science, teaching them for free, and donating stuff. Extremely fun dealing with the kids, highly recommended experience. -->
<!-- 

I also was part of Inquivesta as Spons Exec, and Fest Coordinator. Inquivesta is IISER Kolkata's annual science festival My stints here promptedmini-politics, bureaucratic hurdles, and diplomatic representation that made me a completely different person by the end of the two years I was in these posts. A student council in a young academic institute had oppotinuities for a lot of new initiatives that I managed to start the discussion on many times. However, handling things during Covid 19, online, had its own several limitations. Despite that, we got the mentorship system at undergraduate level, changes in pre-major and major selection policy, etc.<br>
2) <b>Placement Cell</b>: IISER Kolkata being what it is has a weak placement situation since students are so few in number. Hence, I had the opportunity to make some improvements. With the help of Atul Kubare, a 16MS senior, we got placements in Deloitte, a US-origin MNC. This was my biggest achievement here. <br>
3) <b>Inter IISER Meets</b>: I represented in the Inter IISER Sports Meet 2019, and it's analogous Cultural Meet in 2022, wherein I represented IISER Kolkata in 400m Race, and Debate+JAM respectively. With Arkadeep Mitra, 19MS and Pritam Sadhu, 22MS; we got IISER Kolkata it's win in IICM 2022 by bringing the 1000 points associated with a <b>GOLD</b> from Debate.<br>
4) <b>IMUN 2020:</b> Along with Madhur, Shreyash (18MS), I participated in an International MUN Segment. I recieved a Special Mention as the Representative of Czech Republic for articulating precise arguments. <br>
5) <b>Animal Issues Committee</b>: I led a special committee formed at the pleasure of the Chief Warden, IISER Kolkata; that aimed to resolve Human-Animal Conflict (the Dog Issue) at IISER Kolkata. We recommended several useful measures against the entry and settlements of dogs in and around Hostel premises, in a humane manner protecting the rights of the dogs. <br>
6) <b><a href="https://revival.iiserkol.ac.in">Revival 2021</a></b>: In 2021, when Covid 19 had taken over our lives, a few students answered my call to conduct an online Cultural Festival, in response to cancelled Inquivesta and inter-IISER Meets. Thus came the first ever online pan-Indib\a Cultural Festival featuring student participants from ten different institutions across India competing against each other at the comforts of their homes, and connecting inspite of the Lockdown. I managed the host team at IISER Kolkata, and coordinated with other institutes through their representatives to make this a success. 
7) 
6) <b>Miscellaneous</b>: I was active in the organisation of various informal student events like Freshers', Farewell, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Janmashtami, etc. I also played some Kho-kho, football and cricket (extremely bad), and participated in Flashmob, SPICMACAY WB Convention, etc. I was a part of two dramas: one online titled, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VEk7SZP9cM">"MISER Senate"</a>, and another offline on DMS Day 2023, titled "17 Shades of DMS".

<h2 class="section-heading">[For IISER-ites] My Mark at IISER Kolkata</h2>
<p class = "section-content">
<b>This part is special to me, and is intended for those like me.</b>
Unlike most others in the popular kids' gangs, posts, and club-epicenters, I did not know how to boast about the smallest things and feel good about myself. I believed I did not have the skills necessary to be part of any club or join any group. I don't know how to sing, dance, act, draw, etc. Neither was I gifted in atheltics and sports, nor did my unique background allow the natural inclusion into state-groups. <u>If you relate to this, definitely keep reading.</u><br><br> 

I came out of IISER a different man thanks to some people I met along the way. I danced, acted, debated, ran, played some sports, played video-games, and have a group of friends, juniors and seniors who ruthlessly make fun of me, beat me up at GPLs, believe in what I do, and stand up for me. I not only ended up in multiple positions of responsibility at the top of the IISERK-student-food-chain, but also did so whilst handling the toughest curriculum (DMS), in addition to other positions of responsibility. This was also during both, the Covid-19 and post-Covid settings. <b>I dealt with the lowest and highest levels of bureaucracy passionately to voice students' need for a partial/full tuition waiver in the EWS Category, return of students, needs in club-rooms, for IICM Selections, and so on. Representing students in the Senate, IISER Kolkata allowed me to bring many positive changes to the commmunity, and see the nuances first-hand that the Director faced in bringing changes while honoring and/or tolerating different opinions even at his level.</b> <br><br>
<b>I also represented IISER Kolkata in the Inter IISER Sports Meet 2019 (IISM), and won a Gold in Debate for IISER Kolkata in the Inter IISER Cultural Meet 2023 (IICM) alongwith Arkadeep Mitra. When people were complaining of no IICM or Inquivesta in 2020, I came up with the idea of Revival. Most importantly, I managed to convince people to believe in me and we hosted our own Cultural Meet/Fest equivalent online, which was the first of such kind, <a href="https://revival.iiserkol.ac.in">the month-long Revival 2021</a>; to cheer people up during a pandemic.</b> As the only active remaining member of an Inquivesta Committee by then, I had the self-realised responsibility of reviving IISER Kolkata's one and only student-festival. This had to be done under the most difficult circumstances brought about by students' ignorance and ego themselves, and an administration with senior student-stooges exploiting that ignorance. <b>Against all odds, the tenth edition of <a href="https://inquivesta.in">Inquivesta</a> happened after 3 years with zero contribution from the institute</b>. This occured amidst many powerful attempts at stopping me from executing Inquivesta in any level through publicized personal attacks, threats to juniors who worked in the committee behind my back and whatnot. (Lesson: If they have to do these things behind your back and they don't even have the guts to do otherwise, know your place) We even incurred a significant profit, accomplishing the first such milestone for Inquivesta and IISER Kolkata.<br><br>

Details of my drive to do what I did in the five years of my stay through each position I handled, are left for another <a href="iiser.html">webpage</a>, for those interested.<br><br> 

<b>When choosing my major I was told that I will have to leave any thought of a social life if I pursue a Math major. As the first student to have assumed two SAC GS Posts at once (Academic and Cultural 2021-22), someone who has assumed three SAC GS posts in two years, someone who has executed an Inquivesta with zero budget from the institute, someone who executed a month-long online Revival, someone who helped secure placements for 17MS, and did much more without failing any course and whilst maintaining a stable academic standing; I am proof that nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it. I came, I did what I did unapologetically with the best of intentions, and I left a controversial figure with a strong personality, no longer a forgettable existence. I now have the ability to self-evaluate and self-heal. Know that people who you help will always remember you with love and gratitude when they look back. Never let others define you or your capabilities ever. </b><br><br> UG is meant for this kind of identity-search, use all resources available and do it. It's time for me to get into full blown academia mode now as I go on to do a PhD.</p> -->
